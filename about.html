<h2>About Me
  
  INTRO</h2>

<p> i'm  a young nigga of 20 yrs old. I currently reside in the trenches of Rasesa with the family. .</p>

<h3> Professional Interests</h3>

<p> I currently go to BAC (Botswana Accountancy College) ,located in both Gaborone and Francistown , BOTSWANA.
I am pursuing a degree in BSC HONS IN APPLIED BUSINESS COMPUTING .
The course shortly talks about using tehnological developments (software mainly) to solve real life problems in the Business industry .
Graduates are equipped with skills to both begin and manage a business enterprise and tech skills such as coding , systems development, computer technology just to name a few of the modules that make up the course .
I swayed towards the course because i did both Commerce and Computer Studies at a senior level so i had a background of both.
I also felt like the course grants me practically the best of both worlds as Technology and Business as sectors are one of the growing and leading sectors .
