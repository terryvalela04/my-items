<h2>About Me</h2>

<h3> Introduction </h3>
  
<p> i'm  a young nigga of 20 yrs old. I currently reside in the trenches of Rasesa (The Kasi) with the family. .</p>

<h4> Professional Interests</h4>

<p> I currently go to BAC (Botswana Accountancy College) ,located in both Gaborone and Francistown , BOTSWANA.
I am pursuing a degree in BSC HONS IN APPLIED BUSINESS COMPUTING .
The course shortly talks about using tehnological developments (software mainly) to solve real life problems in the Business industry .
Graduates are equipped with skills to both begin and manage a business enterprise and tech skills such as coding , systems development, computer technology just to name a few of the modules that make up the course .
I swayed towards the course because i did both Commerce and Computer Studies at a senior level so i had a background of both.
I also felt like the course grants me practically the best of both worlds as Technology and Business as sectors are one of the growing and leading sectors .


<h5> Hobbies and Social Life</h5>  

<p> I usually play video games such as Call of Duty , FC24 , E-Football , Red dead redemption and Mortal Kombat just to name a few .
I use them as a form of recreation more especially after a long week just to unwind a bit . Social wise  i sometimes meetup 
with a few close friends  simply  just to chill out for a few hours . I also periodically visit art galleries or events because i used to 
do art pieces , portraits in particular but overtime i lost touch with it so i visit these conventions to reconnect in a less hands on approach. </p>
 Music is a big part of my daily routine . When i have time especially on semester breaks i can produce my own beats andmake a playlist of my own 
 . I have produced Trap and Hip Hop beats  in terms of genres . Its something i am learning  to do using FL STUDIO software .</p>
